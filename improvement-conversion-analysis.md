# Transforming Insurance Sales: A Holistic Lifecycle Approach

## The Problem

Traditional insurance sales often follow a piecemeal approach, leading to:

- Fragmented coverage and protection gaps
- Customer fatigue from repeated sales interactions
- Misaligned products across different life stages
- Difficulty in making informed trade-offs between coverage and affordability

## The Solution: Lifecycle-Based Planning

Transform insurance sales from transactional product purchases into a comprehensive financial journey:

1. **Show the Complete Picture First**

   - Present full protection needs across life stages
   - Make coverage gaps and interdependencies visible
   - Demonstrate long-term value and planning rationale

2. **Enable Informed Decision Making**

   - Clear visualization of protection status
   - Transparent trade-offs between coverage and budget
   - Structured path to achieving comprehensive coverage

3. **Progressive Implementation**
   - Prioritized coverage based on critical needs
   - Clear next steps for coverage expansion
   - Budget-aware implementation timeline

## Product Terminology and Parameters

### Implementation and Premium Budgeting

To effectively implement these product offerings based on the client's available fluid cash, we recommend the following approach:

#### Premium Budgeting Examples

**Example 1: Essential Track Client**

- Profile: 30-year-old, $4,000 monthly income, 60% expenditure ratio
- Monthly fluid cash: $1,600 ($19,200 annual)
- Using "Minimal" investment preference (10% allocation): $1,920 annual budget
- Protection allocation (70%): $1,344 annual premium
  - AIA Prime Critical Cover: $672 annual premium
  - AIA HealthShield Gold Max: $480 annual premium
  - AIA Secure Term Plus: $192 annual premium
- Wealth allocation (30%): $576 annual premium
  - AIA Elite Secure Income: $576 annual premium ($48 monthly)

**Example 2: Preferred Track Client**

- Profile: 45-year-old, $8,000 monthly income, 50% expenditure ratio
- Monthly fluid cash: $4,000 ($48,000 annual)
- Using "Balanced" investment preference (25% allocation): $12,000 annual budget
- Protection allocation (40%): $4,800 annual premium
  - AIA Beyond Critical Care: $3,000 annual premium
  - AIA HealthShield Gold Max: $1,800 annual premium
- Wealth allocation (45%): $5,400 annual premium
  - AIA Pro Achiever 3.0: $3,600 annual premium
  - AIA ProRewards: $1,800 annual premium
- Legacy allocation (15%): $1,800 annual premium
  - AIA Pro Lifetime Protector (II) with legacy options: $1,800 annual premium

**Example 3: Prestige Track Client**

- Profile: 58-year-old, $20,000 monthly income, 40% expenditure ratio
- Monthly fluid cash: $12,000 ($144,000 annual)
- Using "Comprehensive" investment preference (40% allocation): $57,600 annual budget
- Protection allocation (25%): $14,400 annual premium
  - AIA Absolute Critical Cover: $8,640 annual premium
  - AIA Platinum International Health: $5,760 annual premium
- Wealth allocation (35%): $20,160 annual premium
  - AIA Platinum Retirement Elite: $20,160 annual premium
- Legacy allocation (40%): $23,040 annual premium
  - AIA Platinum Wealth Legacy: $14,400 annual premium
  - AIA Platinum Generations (II): $8,640 annual premium

#### Phased Implementation Strategy

For clients who may be new to comprehensive financial planning or who have budget constraints, we recommend a phased implementation approach:

**Phase 1: Core Protection**

- Prioritize essential protection products first (health and critical illness)
- Implement AIA HealthShield Gold Max and base critical illness coverage
- This typically requires 40-50% of the allocated premium budget

**Phase 2: Wealth Foundation**

- Add wealth accumulation products suited to the client's investment preference
- For Essential track: AIA Elite Secure Income
- For Preferred track: Start with AIA Pro Achiever 3.0
- For Prestige track: Begin with AIA Platinum Wealth Elite 2.0
- This typically requires 30-40% of the allocated premium budget

**Phase 3: Legacy Planning**

- Complete the portfolio with appropriate legacy planning solutions
- Implement riders for Essential track or dedicated legacy products for Preferred/Prestige tracks
- This typically requires 10-30% of the allocated premium budget depending on life stage

This phased approach ensures clients prioritize essential protection while gradually building a comprehensive financial portfolio aligned with their life stage and investment preferences.

### Current Implementation

A streamlined 2-step process with intelligent plan recommendations:

#### Step 1: Interactive Profile & Plan View

```typescript
interface UserProfile {
  monthlyIncome: number;  // Default: 4000
  expenditureRatio: number;  // As percentage
  investmentPreference: 'Minimal' | 'Balanced' | 'Comprehensive';
  fluidSavings: number;  // Lump sum available for investment
}

// Product Track Classification (internal, not shown to user)
interface ProductTrackClassification {
  range: 'Essential' | 'Preferred' | 'Prestige';
  baseMultiplier: number;  // Base factor for calculations
}

// Investment Preference Multipliers
const PREFERENCE_ALLOCATIONS = {
  // Minimal: Focus on essential protection only
  Minimal: {
    protectionRatio: 0.07,  // 7% of fluid income
    wealthRatio: 0.02,     // 2% to wealth building
    legacyRatio: 0.01,     // 1% to legacy
    comment: 'Prioritizes basic health and life protection',
    totalRatio: 0.10      // 10% total of fluid cash
  },

  // Balanced: Balanced approach
  Balanced: {
    protectionRatio: 0.15,  // 15% of fluid income
    wealthRatio: 0.07,     // 7% to wealth building
    legacyRatio: 0.03,     // 3% to legacy
    comment: 'Balanced protection with wealth building',
    totalRatio: 0.25      // 25% total of fluid cash
  },

  // Comprehensive: Full financial planning
  Comprehensive: {
    protectionRatio: 0.20,  // 20% of fluid income
    wealthRatio: 0.15,     // 15% to wealth building
    legacyRatio: 0.05,     // 5% to legacy
    comment: 'Complete protection with strong wealth focus',
    totalRatio: 0.40      // 40% total of fluid cash
  }
};

// UI Components
interface UIConfig {
  incomeSlider: {
    min: 3000,
    max: 50000,
    default: 4000,
    step: 100,
    format: (value: number) => `$${value.toLocaleString()}/month`
  },
  expenditureSlider: {
    min: 30,  // Minimum 30% for basic living
    max: 90,  // Maximum 90% expenditure
    default: 60,
    step: 5,
    format: (value: number) => `${value}% of income`
  },
  fluidSavingsInput: {
    min: 0,
    max: 1000000,
    default: 0,
    step: 1000,
    format: (value: number) => `$${value.toLocaleString()}`
  }
}
```

#### Step 2: Calculation Engine

```typescript
interface FinancialCapacity {
  monthlyFluidCash: number;
  annualFluidCash: number;
  fluidSavings: number;
  sustainableAllocation: {

      : undefined;

  return {
    protection: protectionPlan,

  // - Term Life: 10x annual income
  // - CI: 5x annual income
  // - Disability: 75% of monthly income
  // - PA: 2x annual income

  return {
